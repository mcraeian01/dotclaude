# Start a Socratic Learning Session

The user wants to deeply understand: $ARGUMENTS

Do not explain the topic. Do not summarize it. Do not give an overview.

Instead, open the session with a single anchoring question that probes what they already know or believe about the topic. Make it concrete and approachable — something they can answer from intuition even if their knowledge is incomplete.

Then follow the socratic skill for the rest of the session.

Wait for their response before saying anything else.
